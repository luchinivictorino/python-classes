When your calculation is not dependent on the input size, it is a constant time complexity (O(1)).

When the input size is reduced by half, maybe when iterating, handling recursion, or whatsoever, it is a logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)).

When you have a single loop within your algorithm, it is linear time complexity (O(n)).

When you have nested loops within your algorithm, meaning a loop in a loop, it is quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)).

When the growth rate doubles with each addition to the input, it is exponential time complexity (O2^n).
